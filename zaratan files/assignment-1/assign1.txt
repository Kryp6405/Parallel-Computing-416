Problem 1 Analysis
------------------
We first set OMP_NUM_THREADS=2, and test the time differences for N=1024 (default) and N=16384 (suggested). 
Note: For all inputs, outputs for min_dist are the same so normal and parallel programs are running correctly.
- For the default input, the non parallel program consitently beats the parallel program by at least a ten-thousandth of a second (np - p >= 0.0001)
	* Non Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.00171
	* Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.00181
- For the suggested input, the parallel program consistently beats the non parallel program by at least a hundredth of a second (p - np >= 0.01)
	* Non Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.441
	* Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.430

Now we set OMP_NUM_THREADS=4, and test the same way.
Note: For all inputs, outputs for min_dist are the same so normal and parallel programs are running correctly.
- For the default input, the non parallel program consitently beats the parallel program by at least a thousandth of a second (np - p >= 0.001)
	* Non Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.00176
	* Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.00207
- For the suggested input, the parallel program consistently beats the non parallel program by around a thousandth of a second (p - np >= 0.001)
	* Non Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.439
	* Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.431

**TO-DO**
Now we set OMP_NUM_THREADS=8, and test the same way.
Note: For all inputs, outputs for min_dist are the same so normal and parallel programs are running correctly.
- For the default input, the non parallel program consitently beats the parallel program by at least a thousandth of a second (np - p >= 0.001)
	* Non Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.00176
	* Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.00207
- For the suggested input, the parallel program consistently beats the non parallel program by around a thousandth of a second (p - np >= 0.001)
	* Non Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.439
	* Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.431

Now we set OMP_NUM_THREADS=16, and test the same way.
Note: For all inputs, outputs for min_dist are the same so normal and parallel programs are running correctly.
- For the default input, the non parallel program consitently beats the parallel program by at least a thousandth of a second (np - p >= 0.001)
	* Non Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.00176
	* Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.00207
- For the suggested input, the parallel program consistently beats the non parallel program by around a thousandth of a second (p - np >= 0.001)
	* Non Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.439
	* Parallel Avg. Run Time = 0.431
